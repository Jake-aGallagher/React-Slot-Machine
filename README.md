### created using react



#### Purpose of this app
The purpose of this app was to create an app with a large amount of state items, which can all be updated independently of each other. for this app I focused on using the useReducer hook. the app also gave me good experience in creating a responsive design and also tested my abiliities at making a suitable colour scheme because I'm more used to making calm simple color scheme where as this was meant to be loud and bold as it's meant to feel like being in a gambling setting.

#### What I learned
Throughout this project I learned that it's very complex trying to get the components and styles to render correctly on all browsers and especially on mobile devices.


#### What improvements could be made
There is almost certainly a better color sceme choice for this senario. that remains bold but is more appealing to the user. would like to swap out the numbers on the spinners for images as well.
